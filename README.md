# Visual Testing at Scale

## Problem Statement - 11

Our design team has created a visual design language that is followed by the app and website. This is laid down in the Figma designs that describe how the screens would look on the app, web (mobile), and web (desktop). The website and app screens are developed against this library of components as documented in Figma. There are predefined rules (font size, padding, number of text lines, etc.) for every component that defines how the component will look on desktop and mobile viewports.
